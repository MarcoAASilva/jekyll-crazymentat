  Hi there, my name is Marco Silva.
  
  **MarcoAASilva** or **dreamcaster** are usually my ID everywhere.
  
  I was born, and raised in Brazil.  I live in Porto Alegre.
  
  I'm really fond of programming, scifi and philosophy.
  
  Crazy Mentat is my first template for the Jekyll engine.  Sorry if something looks a bit over the top, I'm still getting the hang of wearing a designer hat.

> A Mentat is a fictional type of human, presented in [Frank Herbert's science fiction Dune](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/03/dune-50-years-on-science-fiction-novel-world) universe. In an interstellar society that fears a resurgence of artificial intelligence and thus prohibits computers, Mentats are specially trained to mimic the cognitive and analytical ability of electronic computers.
