After much experimenting with Jekyll workflows, here is my first post to this blog template.

# First Tricks

Here are some cool links that may well end up at the header:

* [FrontMatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

You may add a post by creating a file under the *docs/_posts* folder.  Use date format conventions to get chronological order right.

You may control the published state of a post by the **published** global variable in FrontMatter.

> that's how I unpublished Murmur's original posts.  I'm keeping the files at the repo for reference.
